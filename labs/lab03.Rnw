Intro
=====

In this lab we simulate drawing chips from an urn, both with and without replacement, using the `sample()` function.

Prelim-Code
===========

<<prelim>>=
white <- "white"
black <- "black"
sumWhite <- function(col) { sum(col==white) }
sampleUrn <- function(urn,replace) {
    with <- matrix(0,100,100)
    for ( i in 1:100 ) {
      with[,i] <- sample(x=urn,size=100,replace=replace)
    }
    apply(with,2,sumWhite)
  }
@

Section 1
=========

Begin by creating an urn. This urn will have equal numbers (100 white, 100 black).

<<initUrn1>>=
urn1 <- rep(c(white,black),c(100,100))
@

Sample with replacement.

<<with1>>=
Xwith1 <- sampleUrn(urn1,TRUE)
@

Sample without.

<<without1>>=
Xwithout1 <- sampleUrn(urn1,FALSE)
@

Section 2
=========

Begin by creating another urn. This urn will have unequal numbers (20 white, 180 black).

<<initUrn2>>=
urn2 <- rep(c(white,black),c(20,180))
@

Sample with replacement.

<<with2>>=
Xwith2 <- sampleUrn(urn2,TRUE)
@

Sample without.

<<without2>>=
Xwithout2 <- sampleUrn(urn2,FALSE)
@

Section 3
=========

Plot the results.

<<graphing,echo=FALSE,fig=TRUE,jpeg=FALSE,eps=TRUE,format=eps>>=
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(Xwith1,breaks=0:100,ylim=c(0,0.25),prob=TRUE)
hist(Xwith2,breaks=0:100,ylim=c(0,0.25),prob=TRUE)
hist(Xwithout1,breaks=0:100,ylim=c(0,0.25),prob=TRUE)
hist(Xwithout2,breaks=0:100,ylim=c(0,0.25),prob=TRUE)
@

Compute the mean and standard deviation for each.

<<results>>=
c( c(mean(Xwith1), sd(Xwith1), mean(Xwithout1), sd(Xwithout1)),
 c(mean(Xwith2), sd(Xwith2), mean(Xwithout2), sd(Xwithout2)))
@
